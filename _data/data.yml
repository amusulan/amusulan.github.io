    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Welcome! I am a Data/Computational Social Scientist with almost a decade of 
        experience with programming, machine learning, and natural language processing. 
        I expect to graduate from the PhD Political Science program at the University of 
        Toronto in the spring of 2024. I have published three published articles, where 
        I applied my data science skills to address timely and relevant topics, such as 
        online incivility, contact tracing apps, and electoral interference. 

        My research interests include: artificial intelligence and large language models, 
        democratic deliberation online, open access to information, technology and justice, 
        law, public opinion, elections, Canadian public policy, comparative and Canadian 
        politics, political economy and blockchain technology. My PhD thesis investigated 
        the state of democratic deliberation on social media. Through my research, I have 
        become very familiar with APIs, webscraping, and working with big data. I also love 
        working with teams! In addition to being reliable, I am able to communicate 
        effectively with my teammates regardless of their knowledge backgrounds.

        My skills have allowed me to work on a variety of projects outside of academic 
        research, such as visualizing Canadian federal election riding results for CTV, 
        or even collecting and understanding Ethereum blockchain data. Nearly all of the 
        projects I have engaged in have involved learning a new application of my programming 
        skills. With any work I take on, my goal is either to significantly improve my skill 
        set, or substantively add to it. Learning is my passion.

        time: 2018 - 2024
        details: |
          In my dissertation I developed a theory about democratic deliberation on social 
          media. I conducted three empirical studies to test each of the hypotheses from my 
          theory.
          
          My specializations were Comparative and Canadian Politics, with a focus on 
          quantitative methodology courses where I learned about statistics for the social 
          sciences and textual analysis. 
          
          Example courses:
            - Computer-Assisted Textual Analysis
            - Canadian Judicial Politics
            - Multiple Regression for Political Scientists
            - Network Analysis

        details: |
          For my master's research project, I investigated the effect of traditional news
          media on public social media discourse using Granger Causality and semi-supervised
          topic modeling. I presented this work as a poster at the POLMETH Conference in
          2018.
          
          My studies included quantitative methods, the digital side of geopolitics, and a 
          startup development course hosted by the Department of Computer Science Innovation 
          Lab (DCSIL) at the University of Toronto. 
          
          For "The Business of Software" course, I was paired with two computer science 
          undergraduate students and we developed a Virtual Reality (VR) business. I was 
          responsible for the ideation and business development, including, for example, 
          market research, value proposition, and pitch preparation.

          Example courses:
            - The Business of Software
            - Quantitative Methods and Data Analysis
