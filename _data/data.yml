career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Welcome! I am a Data Scientist with almost a decade of experience programming, 
        using machine learning, and natural language processing. I expect to graduate 
        from the PhD Political Science program at the University of Toronto in the spring 
        of 2024. 

        My research interests include: artificial intelligence and large language models, 
        democratic deliberation online, open access to information, technology and justice, 
        law, public opinion, elections, Canadian public policy, comparative and Canadian 
        politics, political economy and blockchain technology. My PhD thesis investigated 
        the state of democratic deliberation on social media. Through my research, I have 
        become very familiar with APIs, webscraping, and working with big data. I also love 
        working with teams! In addition to being reliable, I am able to communicate 
        effectively with my teammates regardless of their knowledge backgrounds.

        My skills have allowed me to work on a variety of projects outside of academic 
        research, such as visualizing Canadian federal election riding results for CTV, 
        or even collecting and understanding Ethereum blockchain data. Nearly all of the 
        projects I have engaged in have involved learning a new application of my programming 
        skills. With any work I take on, my goal is either to significantly improve my skill 
        set, or substantively add to it. Learning is my passion.

          # My specializations were Comparative and Canadian Politics, with a focus on

          # Lab (DCSIL) at the University of Toronto. 
          
          # For "The Business of Software" course, I was paired with two computer science
